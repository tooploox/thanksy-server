## Step 1: App deployment

    $ heroku create
    $ git push heroku master
    $ heroku buildpacks:set heroku/ruby
    $ heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
    $ heroku run rake db:migrate
    $ heroku open


Alternatively, you can deploy your own copy of the app using the web-based flow:

## Step 2: Building slack app

1. Visit the [Slack API vebsite](https://api.slack.com/) and click the `Start Building` button.
Then you will see the following popup. Fill in the name of the application (We recommend name `Thanksy`) and select your workspace.

2. The next step is to configure two commands. Click `Features -> Slash Commands` and use the `Create New Command` option to create them.
Remember to enter the appropriate server address. Replace the `thanksy.server` placeholder with the address of the application you deployed in the previous step.

5. At this step, specify a scopes. Thanksy saves some data to minimize the number of requests to the `Slack API` . To fetch this data, we require the following permissions:

6. If the scopes have been defined you can install you app.

7. Last but not least. You must add three env variables in the options of your project on heroku. `SLACK_TOKEN` can be found in the `Basic Information -> App Credentials` section. It is called `Verification Token`. `SLACK_API_TOKEN` is located in the `OAuth & Permissions -> OAuth Tokens & Redirect URLs` section. `AUTH_TOKEN` is generated by you. It is simple method of authorization between frontend app and thanksy backend.
